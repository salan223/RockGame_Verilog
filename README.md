# RockBlaster Game (Verilog Project)

🎮 **Purpose**  
Developed a digital RockBlaster game using **Verilog** to implement gameplay logic, controls, and visual output.

🔧 **Tech Stack**  
- Verilog  
- **Finite State Machines (FSMs)**  
- **Multiplexers (MUX)**  
- Counters and Adders  
- VGA Display Interface  
- Debouncing Circuits  

💡 **Key Features**  
- 🕹️ **Game Logic**: FSMs to manage states like idle, play, collision, and scoring.  
- 🔄 **Dynamic Control**: MUX for obstacle selection, adders for scoring, and clock dividers for timing.  
- 📊 **VGA Display**: Real-time game visuals using a hardware-driven VGA interface.  
- 🖲️ **Input Stability**: Debouncing circuits for error-free user interactions.

🚀 **Skills Gained**  
- Advanced knowledge of Verilog and digital logic design principles.  
- Expertise in FSMs, VGA display design, and FPGA debugging.  

🌟 **Outcome**  
Demonstrated the potential of hardware description languages in creating an interactive, hardware-accelerated gaming system.
